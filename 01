def_networking: connected

              1)private_network
              2)public_network

Identify_devices on a network:
  1)name: IP(Internet Protocol) Address
          -unique to yourself
          -protocol (to communicate in the same language)
              a)IPv4 : 4 octets
              b)IPv6 : more recent, due to shortage, longer than IPv4
          1.1)public_address: to Identify_devices on the internet
                          by internet service provider(ISP)
                          HOME
                          (86.157.52.21)
          1.2)private_address: to Identify a device among other devices
                          (192.168.1.77)
                          each laptop
  2)fingerprints: MAC(Media Access Control) Address
                  serial_num, globally uninuqe <--> spoofing
                  12 character hexa_decimal
                  (a4:c3:f0:85:ac:2d)
                  MAC Address control: hotel & ecafe "Guest"/"Public" wifi pay per device

Ping(ICMP):
  Ping(network tool) uses ICMP(Internet Control Message Protocol) packets
                      to determine if the connection btw devices exists/reliable


<Intro_LAN(Local Area Network)>

LAN Topology: network design
  1)Star Topology : centralised router -> many devices, common, easy, $
  2)Bus T : backbone cable(single cable), slow, difficult to troubleshoot/identity, one fail->all down, cost_efficient(+)
  3)Ring(Token) T: not common, mash network

Switch: device within network to aggregate multiple devices
        port for devices to plug into
        efficient
        packet switching

Router: connect networks & pass data btw
        computer 1 -> router 1 -> router 2 -> computer 2

Sub_netting: spliting network into smaller, 4 bytes(32 bits), 0-255
  1)network address(192.168.1.0): Identify the start of the network
  2)host address(192.168.1.100): Identify a device on the subnet
  3)default gateway : assigned to a device on the network-capable of sending information to another network )
                    (192.168.1.1 or 192.168.1.254)

ARP(Address Resolution Protocol) protocol:
  -identify themselves on a network
  -associate its MAC address(physical identifier)
              with an IP address(logical identifier) on the network
  -find the MAC address of a device for communication
  -HOW) cache(store identifiers of other devices on the network)
       APR Request -> every other devices on a network "match MAC => IP ? " -> No
       -> APR Reply (back to initial device) -> remembered & stored in cache

DHCP(Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) Protocol:
  -device connects to a network
    =>DHCP Discover -> DHCP Offer -> DHCP Request -> DHCP ACK
      (give me IP)     (here)        (will do)       (u may use for _time)
